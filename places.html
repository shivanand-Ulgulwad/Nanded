        <p id="fort">Kandhar Fort, located about 55 km from Nanded in Maharashtra, is a historically significant fortress originally built in the 10th century CE by Rashtrakuta King Krishna III, who ruled from Malkhed. It served as a major military and administrative center during the Rashtrakuta dynasty, which controlled large parts of the Deccan region. The fort, spread over 24 acres on the banks of the Manyad River, was continuously occupied and expanded by successive rulers including the Yadavas of Devgiri, Delhi Sultanate, Bahmani Sultanate, Nizam Shahis of Ahmadnagar, and finally the Nizams of Hyderabad. Unlike many forts built on hilltops, Kandhar Fort is constructed on flat land and is surrounded by a 12-meter-high wall with 18 watchtowers and a wide moat filled with water, providing strong defense. The fort’s architecture reflects layers of history, with additions from various dynasties, including a main gate bearing an inscription from Muhammad bin Tughlaq.  </p>

        <p id="unkeshwar">Unkeshwar is a renowned pilgrimage and natural wellness site located in Kinwat taluka of Nanded district, Maharashtra, famous for its ancient Shiva temple and unique hot springs. The temple, dedicated to Lord Shiva, is steeped in legend and is believed to be mentioned in the Ramayana, with stories suggesting that Lord Rama, Sita, and Lakshman spent time here during their exile, and that sage Bhrigu also performed penance at this spot. Unkeshwar’s main attraction is its natural hot water springs, rich in sulfur and believed to have medicinal properties, especially beneficial for skin ailments; bathing in these springs is considered both spiritually purifying and physically healing. The temple’s Shiva lingam, known as "Upaling," is said to offer the same spiritual merit as visiting the twelve Jyotirlingas, making it a significant destination for devotees who cannot undertake the longer pilgrimage. </p>

        <p id="guru">The Gurudwara Hazur Sahib in Nanded, Maharashtra, is one of the five Takhts (seats of authority) in Sikhism and holds immense historical and spiritual significance as the place where the tenth Sikh Guru, Guru Gobind Singh Ji, spent his final days and was cremated in 1708. Situated on the banks of the Godavari River, this magnificent gurudwara was constructed between 1832 and 1837 under the patronage of Maharaja Ranjit Singh. The gold-plated dome and intricate architecture make it a stunning landmark. Inside, the Angitha Sahib marks the exact spot of Guru Gobind Singh’s cremation, and the gurudwara houses several artifacts belonging to him, including weapons and personal items. Guru Gobind Singh Ji declared the Guru Granth Sahib as the eternal Guru here, a pivotal moment in Sikh history. The gurudwara is also known for its evening laser show narrating the lives of the Sikh Gurus, attracting devotees and tourists alike. Easily accessible by air, rail, and road, Hazur Sahib remains a vital pilgrimage destination, symbolizing faith, sacrifice, and Sikh heritage in Nanded.</p>

        <p id="Mahur">Mahur is a historic and culturally rich town located in the Nanded district of Maharashtra, India, renowned for its ancient temples, scenic beauty, and spiritual significance. It is especially famous for the Renuka Devi Temple, dedicated to Goddess Renuka, the mother of Lord Parashurama, one of the ten avatars of Lord Vishnu. The temple is a major pilgrimage site attracting devotees from across Maharashtra and neighboring states, especially during the annual fair held in the month of Chaitra (March-April). Mahur is often referred to as the "Kashi of the South" due to its religious importance and the belief that a pilgrimage here holds similar spiritual merit as visiting Kashi (Varanasi). The town is nestled amidst hills and forests, offering a tranquil environment that complements its sacred atmosphere. Besides the Renuka temple, Mahur is dotted with several other ancient shrines and historical sites, making it a significant destination for those interested in spirituality, history, and nature. Its blend of mythology, devotion, and natural beauty makes Mahur a unique and cherished locale in the Marathwada region.</p>
